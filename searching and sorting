# SEARCHING AND SORTING 

 1) linear searching 
     O(n)

2) Binary Search 
    for using the binary search the element should in monotonic order , means either they should ascending or descending
     basically array should be sorted 

     O(logn)
   for binary search we can calculate mid = start+(end - start) /2
       in first iteration n/2 students 
       in second iteration n/4 students 
       in third iteration n/8 students 
       and so on in last iteration their willl be n/2^k students  , and this n/^k when it's size =1
         therefore n/2^k = 1 => n= 2^k => taking log both the side  log n = k
