Q. What is collection?
Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known 
as collection of objects.

framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture
collection framework is java API which provides architecture to store and manipulate
group of objects            \
                             \   
                      classes and interfaces --> store and manipulate --> group of objects
u will find this library in java.util package 

### collection hierarchy 

                               COLLECTION(methods it represents a group pf objects as single unit)
                               /          \  
                             /              \
                           /                 \
                      LIST                  SET
       indexed collection[0,1,2...]        not indexed cell
      order is preserved duplicates        order not pres. duplicates not
      are allowed                          allowed
              /    |     \                                 /          \
             /     VECTOR  \                              /            \
            /      legacy    \                         HASHSET          SORTEDSET
\          /     additional feature                  same as set           means element 
          /        dynamic array  \                 implementation class    will be sort in these
         /          thread safe     \                     |                          \
        |              |             |                 LINKED HASHSET                 TREESet
        |            STACK (lifo)    |                order will be preserved           sorted, asc num , string
        |                            |
        ARRAYLIST           LINKED LIST
     dynamic array            doubley linked list
    new array created when       in thid mode will add 
    order gets filled up          only when needed
       not thread safe



* being thread safe means two method of vector cannot use it simantenously and that makes it
   synchronused and other non synchronised.

## ways for traversing the element of collection

                                         iterable  for-each(1)            method  another way
             forword                           |                         foreach() -(5)  
            iterator ---has a object--->  collection
                |
          (listiterator)  ---> list (but only applied to list)
              backward           \
                                  \
                                   \
                                  vector ( has it's own methods for iteration )
                                        enumeration 
                                       applied to stack also as followed by vector
