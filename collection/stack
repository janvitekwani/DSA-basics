Boolean      empty() tests if this stack is empty
E            peek () look at the object at the top of this stack without 
              removing it from the stack
E            pop() removes the object at the top of this stack and returns
            that object as the value of this function
E            push (e items )onto the top of this stack
int          search (object o) returns the 1-based position where an object 
             is on this stack


Stack <Integer> no = new Stack<>();
no.push(25);
no.push(50);
no.push(2);
System.out.println(no.search(2));// used for searching the elements 



* there are few methods whcih are return in bold in stack and remaining are the 
   vectors as it is the base class for the stack
