******************* patterns to solve the questions of sliding windows *****************************
# u have a given a problem and in that problem u take a particular that is called as sliding windows

# 4 key patterns are their in it 
1) fixed size window 
2) sometimes u donot know the size of the particular window
3) two pointer approach 
4) u need a external data structure (this is called optimized sliding windows)

Q. what happens in fixed size window pattern 
A.   let's take a pattern
             A[] ={ 1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7 } k =3; (means u need three size window)
                    '''''' =3
                      ''''''' =3       { so everytime u will put this logic in this these
                          ''''''=5        kind of question }
                              '''''=5
